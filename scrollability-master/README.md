Scrollability
=============

Scrollability adds a good imitation of iOS native scrolling to your mobile web apps.

Scrollability is a single script, it's small, and it has no external dependencies. Drop it into your page, add a few CSS classes to scrollable elements, and scroll away. 

Status
------

This project is a work-in-progress, but I hope to have a stable, documented release in time for iOS 5. Stay tuned!

Plan
----

As of this writing, Scrollability supports only basic vertical or horizontal scrolling.  Future plans include:

* Snapping to pages
* Sticky table headers
* Photo browser
* More customization of the animation details
